<!-- <h1>{{hero}}</h1> -->
<!--  The page no longer displays properly because you changed the hero from a string to an object.-->
<!--  Update the binding in the template to announce the hero's name and show both id and name in a details layout like this: -->
<h2>{{superhero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
<!-- The word uppercase in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator ( | ), activates the built-in UppercasePipe.
Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. 
Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.-->
<!-- You applied the UppercasePipe to format the name.-->
<div>
  <span>id: </span>{{superhero.id}}</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <span>id: </span>{{superhero.age}}</div>
  <div>
    <span>name: </span>{{superhero.name}}</div>
  <!-- Users should be able to edit the hero name in an <input> textbox.
The textbox should both display the hero's name property and update that property as the user types. That means data flow from the component class out to the screen and from the screen back to the class.
To automate that data flow, setup a two-way data binding between the <input> form element and the hero.name property.
Refactor the details area in the HeroesComponent template so it looks like this: -->
  <div>
    <label>
      <input [(ngModel)]="superhero.name" placeholder="name">
      <!-- to use ngModel you need to import FormsModule dans le app.module.ts -->
      <!-- You used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive.-->
    </label>
  </div>
